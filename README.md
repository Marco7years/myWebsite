# myWebsite

This is the source code of my Personal Website. I will use this site as a portfolio of my projects and to speak a little about myself,
indeed this will be used to introduce myself to new Companies to work with/for.

I'll use this project to get my hands on Web Development and to regain some knowledge that I may need to refresh.
